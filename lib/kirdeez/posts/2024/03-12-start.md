These Whatch-Ma-Callems are just gonna be my thoughts spilled out in these blog like posts, so don't expect correct grammer or coherent thoughts. I'm gonna be learning and trying to explain how I understand certain subjects, such as math, game dev, and low-level stuff. I like to code in C, Rust and Elixir. This site is actually made with Phoenix, even though it's overkill, it's cool. I also have no idea how to style markdown with TailwindCSS, so these post won't look too great.
