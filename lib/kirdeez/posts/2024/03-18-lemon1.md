This is the beginning of my game engine journey. I want to be a game dev, but I also want to make my own engine because I think it would be cool. I want to understand how an engine works under the hood. Making a game with it is the least of my concerns, but would still be cool to say "I made this in my own custom engine". I'm going to be learning through the Handmade Hero series and the Kohi game engine series. I have no clue what I'm doing, and I find that some kind of structured learning suits me best. I'll mostly be following the Kohi YouTube series, as he seems to just have it all figured out.
